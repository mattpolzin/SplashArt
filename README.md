SplashArt
=========

Idea I had for a simple drawing app. I think it is pretty fun to use already, but there is room for improvement in rendering (if the OpenGL stuff ever gets done) and lots of room for fun new features.


Concept: Click to create "splashes" of color by flipping tiles.
Twist: When a tile flips, it rotates through a discrete set of colors.
